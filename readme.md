# Hacker-news
This is a very sad looking hacker news client built with Mithril.js, Modular-css, Firebase, and my blood sweat and tears. 

It's less of a visual "wow" and more of a POC. :)

Hoping to get some time soon to make it look a LITTLE less like crap and actually give it some more substantive, useful features!
